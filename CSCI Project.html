			<p>My name is Riley Levitt. I am from Atlanta, Georgia. I enjoy playing sports and hunting. I have played baseball all my life, and when I am not playing baseball I am hunting. I duck hunt and quail hunt vefy often. I also have an interesting hobby, which is mounting animals. I often have friends come to me and ask me to make them specific mounts that they ask for. I find it very intertaining and enjoy doing it whenever I have time.</p>

		 <p>Since getting introduced to stuffing animals, I have stuffed a variety of animals. I have had friends come to me for duck, pheasant, and deer mounts. It takes many hours to finnish stuffing an animal. You have to be very careful and precise in order to make the finished product look perfect. I have made a decent amont of money doing this, however, it is not about the money for me. I enjoy making mounts and it is a fun way to pass my free time.</p>
